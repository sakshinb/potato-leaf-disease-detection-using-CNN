# Potato-leaf-disease-detection-using-CNN
Potato crops are highly susceptible to various leaf diseases, which can significantly impact yield and quality. Traditional disease detection methods rely on manual inspection, which is time-consuming and often inaccurate. This project aims to develop an automated Potato Leaf Disease Detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify healthy and diseased potato leaves efficiently.

The primary objectives of this project include:

Developing a deep learning-based approach for potato leaf disease classification.
Collecting and preprocessing an annotated dataset of potato leaf images.
Training and evaluating a CNN model to achieve high accuracy in disease detection.
Deploying the model for real-world agricultural applications to assist farmers.
The methodology follows a structured approach:

Dataset Collection: Images of healthy and diseased potato leaves were gathered from open-source datasets.
Preprocessing: Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation and normalization, were applied to enhance model generalization.
Model Development: A CNN model was designed and trained using TensorFlow/Keras.
Evaluation: The model's performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Deployment: The trained model can be integrated into a mobile or web-based application for real-time detection.
Key results indicate that the proposed CNN model achieved an accuracy of over 90%, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting potato leaf diseases. The model successfully identified diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves, reducing dependency on manual inspection.

In conclusion, this project highlights the potential of deep learning in precision agriculture. Implementing such AI-driven solutions can help farmers detect plant diseases early, take timely action, and improve crop health, ultimately leading to increased agricultural productivity. Future work includes improving the model with transfer learning and expanding it to detect a wider range of plant diseases.
